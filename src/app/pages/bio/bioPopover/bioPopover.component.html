  <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.25em;">Childhood and Family Values</h2>
</ion-card-subtitle>
  <p>Going back to being the youngest of ten; I've seen much hardships, not only in my life but in my family as well. We were never wealthy or even middle class. We struggled but as a family were always together. Foodstamps were a lifeline for us. Government assistance was no stranger for us. 
    There's a tension in this upbringing. Or moreso a balance if you look long and hard enough. The tension is the perception that financial security is the end goal. But in reality, security without relationship is a terribly lonely thing. Scary in fact. Money isn't a guarantee. Tools break and get stole, lost, and lose value. 
    I suppose money is the same. A tool not always reliable. A powerful one, absolutely. However, it is no saviour. People are, and money is a powerful tool for aid.
    In the history of mankind, despite the struggle, we have conquered all hardships together. 
    This is where my perspective of balance has given me peace in knowing the better option. </p> 
    <p style="text-align:center;">People | relationships | community.</p>

    <p>These are the better options. Throughout our struggle as a family, we were always that. Family. 10 boxcar children thriving in the midst of struggle. I've seen sacrifice, even when it seemed to cost one of us so much. Yet, our love and connection was the fruit of such a cost. 
      I know the better option, and from this upbringing, I've come to devalue finances as a "need" (from the misunderstanding that people seem to think it's a human-core need) and moreso a tool.
      On the topic of relationship, struggle can bring out the truest form of who we are. all the brokeness and ungliness.
      It's east to be clean, cut, and proper when life is easy, but when it's not, all of us is exposed. But the beauty of this is the opportunity to excercise grace.
      Grace that we are all fallible, and none are innocent from offense or judgemental assumptions. The ugliness of people tells us more about ourselves than them.
      Being reactive exposes a loss of identity. How others treat me will not determine how I treat them. Hurting people hurt people and despite the hurt in me, I will do whatever is in me to avoid hurting.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">The power of communication and compassion. Self-awareness and empathy. Grace and connection.</p>
     
     <p>It's rarely ever the tool, and almost always the carpenter. The tools are only as helpful, destructive, or efficient as the one wielding it.
      Much like coding. A poorly written loop could cause irreparable damage. (insert nervous sweating emoji).</p>
